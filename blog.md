We're thrilled to announce the first significant improvements to the [Agentverse](https://agentverse.ai/) virtual hub. The Agentverse recently launched to provide easier access to the Fetch.ai automated agent technology. The hub offers guided walk-throughs and simple examples to help you get started. 

New to Agentverse? Read our launch blog [here](https://fetch.ai/content-hub/article/fetch-ai-agentverse).

Today we release storage and protocol examples as well as debugging and back-end optimization upgrades. These updates bring managed agents further in line with the capabilities of the broader Microagent framework, ensuring that hosted agents in the Agentverse have nearly the same capabilities as locally created ones. 

### Feature updates

Storage and protocol examples are highly impactful regardless if a solution is entirely agent-based or embedded within a broader application. The storage functionality enables agents to record data between messages and internal handlers. In other words, you can store information as a JSON file within the agent's local storage. Meanwhile, protocols enable a simple standard for agent communication facilitating increased agent connectivity. 

### Debugging and back-end optimization updates

Beyond feature releases, we have overhauled the managed agent runtime. Everyone can expect a more native debugging experience, including better exception handling, reporting and adding missing features like the 'print' command. In addition, errors are caught lower down in the stack, resulting in less of your computation time allocation being used for failing code. We've also released several updates to improve processes running in the background so everyone can look forward to faster running and more fault-tolerant code. 

### Actionable feedback

We look forward to hearing from our community and receiving actionable feedback regarding the Agentverse platform. As part of the v0.2.0 release, we've integrated this directly into the interface. Login to Agentverse and use the icon in the top right corner of the screen to leave your feedback, whether thatâ€™s a feature request, improvement idea or constructive feedback for the developer team. 

Join our growing community and learn how to leverage agent-based technology to introduce secure, scalable automation in any context.
