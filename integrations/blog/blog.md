We're thrilled to announce the launch of [Agentverse](https://agentverse.ai/), a virtual hub that's designed to help you engage with Fetch.ai’s autonomous agent technology, regardless of your technical expertise. Through simple examples you can take a step-by-step approach to creating and deploying your own agent within the Fetch.ai network. 

So, what exactly is an Agent? Agents are bits of code that can perform meaningful activities within the Fetch.ai network. They have the ability to act on your behalf for example, to learn, predict and transact autonomously which can be leveraged in various contexts, such as chatbot development, industrial process automation, IOT network connectivity, DeFi, and much more. In fact, it's such a widely applicable technology that we don’t yet know all the potential use cases. Still, one thing is certain - it's a powerful and paradigm-shifting communication medium.

The Agentverse provides an accessible way to interact with and understand agents, introducing foundational concepts such as agent discovery, remote communication, and storage. For the more adventurous, Agentverse offers a path to prototype, test, and develop intelligent agents. Additionally, the platform serves as the hub from which you can seamlessly manage your agents into the future. 

We hope you'll take this opportunity to discover the power of Fetch.ai's agent technology and understand how this new peer-to-peer communications medium can fundamentally change the way we live and work.

### V1 of the Agentverse platform

In its current iteration, the Agentverse shows you how to create a simple agent on the Fetch.ai network. The platform guides you through the search and discovery process through which you can find and connect with other agents. You can also use the mailroom feature to set up an email-like inbox for your agent, allowing it to send and receive mail without the need for a continuous internet connection. Taken together, the use cases showcased in Agentverse demonstrate agents' ability to interact and communicate remotely, execute scheduled tasks, and handle protocols such as “http”. 

We have a series of planned updates to continue to grow the functionality of the platform. There are plenty of reasons to check back to discover more about this core technology. For now you can access a guided tour of the platform by logging into Agentverse and clicking on the question mark symbol next to the profile icon. The guided tours are specific to each page ensuring that everyone can quickly understand and effortlessly navigate the platform. 

For Developers, Agentverse provides a robust tool to create, test, and deploy agents. It's particularly beneficial for Python-based developers who can audit and modify an agent's code and see how it responds to those modifications in real-time.

Notably, the graphical interface, combinated with the library of pre-built Microagents, marks a significant accomplishment in decreasing the barriers to broader adoption. Microagents are small, lightweight programs that can perform specific tasks similar to microservices in the traditional programming paradigm. They can be integrated into larger applications or run independently and are designed to operate autonomously.

These template-based agents can be created seamlessly and serve to educate and decrease prototyping time. Even with beginner level Python knowledge, template based agents can be customized and configured to meet various needs. Developers can use these pre-built agents as a starting point for their projects or use them as-is to gauge the viability of agent-based technology in a commercial or industrial context.

Beyond the development environment, as part of the initial release, the platform will come with a built-in statistics dashboard that makes it easy to control and monitor the behavior of individual agents. The dashboard offers persistent oversight and analysis over agents' performance, and ensures agents are operating within specific parameters. 

The Agentverse is an exciting technology showcase and tool that serves as a portal to the broader agent-based frameworks and toolsets. It provides a library of pre-built agents, an analytics dashboard, and an intuitive interface, making it a powerful platform for creating intelligent software agents. Whether you're an experienced developer or a newcomer, the Agentverse welcomes you. [Sign up](http://agentverse.ai) and be among the first to experience this transformative technology.
